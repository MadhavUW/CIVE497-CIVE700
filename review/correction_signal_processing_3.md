## Comment
The Nyquist frequency is 30 Hz, which is the half of the sampling frequency of 60Hz. There exists 40 Hz alising frequency but we can't measure it. From the aliasing diagram, the aliasing frequency becomes 20Hz, (4-100/30)*30Hz = 20Hz. 

This aliasing frequency is occurred when the original frequency wave is shifted to 2fs in the right direction (orange signal).

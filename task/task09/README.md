# Task08: Neural Network

**Announcement**: April 09, 2021    
**Due date**: April 23, 2021 (Friday) before 11:59 pm      

**NO MORE DELAY: Please submit your report earlier**   

The main goal of this task is to understand the fundamental of neural network through training your own models. Several sample examples are provided in the [**tutorial**](../../tutorial/neural_network/neural_network_code). I recommend reviewing the tutorial codes in the folder and making an effort to learn how the codes work.  
    
## Problem 1 (40 points)
**(a)** Try out a neural network playground in this link: [http://playground.tensorflow.org](http://playground.tensorflow.org). Run all four examples by changing features, # of hidden layers, # of neurons, activation function, and/or learning rate. Please watch a convergence speed of the loss depending on the parameter changes that you made. (You do not need to include your results in your report).

**(b)** Please run all demos in the [**tutorial**](../../tutorial/neural_network/neural_network_code). I recommend that you configure parameters to improve the results. Please watch my review video.

(Sorry, I used a wrong microphone so the audio quality is not good).

In your report, **briefly** explain (1) an objective of each sample demo, (2) what change you made in default codes or you made (if you configure the network), and (3) a screenshot of the final plot. Basically, you introduce your model and its performance. The default parameters are the ones that I tuned but might not be the best. You can find better neural network architecture by changing # of neurons, activation functions, or loss function. You can also change the learning rate. If you achieve performance improvement, please introduce your network configuration. You can allow changing the code if you can improve the model performance.  

## Problem 2 (60 points) 
You are going to build your own model using neural network. Create your own dataset and build a classifier. Please do not create the dataset similar to the examples provided. Please be creative! You will get the idea from the several demos in the tutorial. For example, like the polynomial example, think about making a sample data from a known model. 

## Submission of Your Work

* A subject of your email must be the format of "Task09_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`"
	* `Your name`: first five lower-case letter your **first + last** name. It should be lower case. (i.g Chul Min Yeum -> chulmi, Juan Park -> juanp)   
	* `Degree`: pick your degree among BA, ME, MA, and PH (BA=Undergraduate, ME=MEng, MA=MASc, and PH=PhD)  
	* `ID`: your school ID
	* Please do not include any other text except this subject line.    
* Your report includes styled codes for all three problems (please check the Markdown tutorial for code styling). 
* The report must be written with Markdown script (GFM) and all other formats like .docx or .pptx are not permitted. 
* You should also include a report in pdf that is converted from your report in Markdown.  
* In your submission folder, you should include a report in the format of both .pdf and .md in a folder. And, it should be zipped before attaching it to your email. 
* The formats of the folder and files are 
	* Folder name: Task09_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID` (same with the subject of your email)

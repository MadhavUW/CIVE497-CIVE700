# Task8: Machine Learning Using Azure ML 

**Announcement**: April 02, 2020    
**Due date**: April 25, 2020 (Wednesday) before 11:59 pm      

**NO MORE DELAY: Please submit your report earlier**   

In this task, I am giving you two problems that can be easily solved by only tuning the parameters (except Problem 1(a)). However, to better understanding the neural network, I recommend reviewing all codes in the folder and making an effort to learn how the codes work.  

The main goal of this task is to train your own machine learning models 


understand the fundamental of structure from motion through developing your own measurement tool. A draft of a code (`demo_code_v8_base.m`) is provided and you need to write your own codes in `YOUR CODE HERE` to complete your tool. 11 Problems and relevant guidelines are included in the code.   
    
## Problem 1 (60 points)

Yo
1. Accuracy plot 
2. 
3. Repeat this process using 

## Problem 2 (60 points) 
You are going to make your own data set and training the models. If you see the I 
NNERUAL networks. 
I will give you extra marks if you generate creative dataset and 
For example. 
You can sovle regression problems. 

## Submission of Your Work
* You should turn in a report and codes to uw.task@gmail.com. When you send your email, please cc your email for future reference.  
* A subject of your email must be the format of "Task8_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`"
	* `Your name`: first five letter your first + last name. The first letter is uppercase and the rest of them are lowercase (i.g Chul Min Yeum -> Chulmi, Juan Park -> Juanp)   
	* `Degree`: pick your degree among BA, ME, MA, and PH (BA=Undergraduate, ME=MEng, MA=MASc, and PH=PhD)  
	* `ID`: your school ID
	* Please do not include any other text except this subject line.    
* For writing equations, I recommend the use of latex equations editors introduced in the Markdown tutorial and inserting equation links. However, I also accept for attaching an image of your handwritten equation (but not recommend). 
* Your report includes your answers and styled codes for questions in the problems.
* You have to submit **a single code file** that includes the codes for all problems.
* The formats of the folder and files are 
	* Folder name: Task8_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID` (same with the subject of your email)  
	* File names: "Code_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`.m or .py" for codes and "Rept_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`.md and .pdf".   
* The report must be written with Markdown script (GFM) and all other formats like docx or pptx are not permitted. 
* You should also include a report in pdf that must be converted from your report in Markdown.
* Please review the general submission instruction in the course syllabus. 
* When you violate these submission guideline, your report will be returned and must be resubmitted. 
> For example, Juan Park is using MATLAB to complete the Task8. Juan needs to submit his report and codes to **uw.task@gmail.com** with an attachment of **Task8_Juanp_BA_000000.zip**. In the folder, there are at least three files: 
> * Code_Juanp_BA_000000.m
> * Rept_Juanp_BA_000000.md
> * Rept_Juanp_BA_000000.pdf
* You may need to include all figures used for writing your report. 

## Note
* Please post a question if you need to help understand the problem and/or tutorials. 
* You are permitted to discuss the task with your colleague.   
* Your grade depends on the completeness and clarity of your work.  
* You should include clear and concise comments in your codes.

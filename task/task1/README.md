# Task01: Programming Practice

**Announcement**: January 12, 2020  
**1st Due Date**: January 20, 2019 before 11:59 pm
**2nd Due Date**: January 27, 2019 before 11:59 pm  

**Problem Description**  
The main goal of this task is to prepare for your programming activities throughout the course. It is a good opportunity for reviewing the programming course materials that you learned in your undergraduate. You can review your own course material or the instructor's teaching material from [AE/ENVE/GEOE121](https://github.com/chulminy/AE_ENVE_GEOE_121#course-outline) 

In Task01, the two programming tasks were posted on [**MATLAB Grader**](https://grader.mathworks.com/courses/27793-cive497-700-smart-structure-technology-winter-2021). You need to get a permission from the instructor to access those problems. The MATLAB Grader allows students instant feedback on the correctness of their solutions through the pre-designed testers. Thus, students can be highly motivated and inspired to persevere with completing the assignments. You can find a short tutorial here: [How to use MATLAB Grader?](https://github.com/chulminy/AE_ENVE_GEOE_121/tree/master/S2020/tutorial/matlab_grader)

You are going to solve "poker game" and "word puzzle" problems. Note that these two problems were the homework assignments of the instructor's computational method course (first-year undergraduate course). 

Here are the specific directions for MATLAB or Python users:

**MATLAB users**  
If you can pass the testers for both problems with your own code without hard coding (e.g., manually typing the locations of the words to pass the tester for the word puzzle problem), you are done. You can start to prepare a report following to the guideline below. Note that for a poker game problem, problems started with "(testing)" are just to help designing all nine functions needed to solve the "(main)" problem. You should pass "(main)" problem, not "(testing)" problems.  

**Python users**  
If you are Python users, you cannot use MATLAB grader features. However, you can still do homework. First, you must carefully read problem descriptions on the MATLAB Grader. Then, you can directly use these two files ("puzzle.txt" and "poker_card.txt") to find (1) 10 words locations and (2) ranks for 1000 card sequences. If you read the problem descriptions, you can understand what you should do with these two files. For a poker game problem, true ranks for all sequences in 'poker_card.txt' are given in 'soln_ranks.txt'. All files are posted on this page or download through this [link](task1.zip). For Python users, you should show in the report that (1) your code can identify the locations of all 10 words in the puzzle and (2) the ranks from your code are identical to the ones in 'soln.ranks.txt'. For example, you may write a code to check that your output is identical to the values in 'soln_ranks.txt'. Once you complete the coding, you can start to prepare a report following to the guideline below. 

If students complete this task using Python, they will receive 3 extra points. This is because python users will spend much more time to complete this task. However, this does not mean that the instructors encourage students python programming. Either one is fine.    

**Submission of Your Work**
* You should turn in a report to uw.task@gmail.com. When you send your email, please cc your email for future reference.  
* A subject of your email must be the format of "Task01_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`"
	* `Your name`: first five lower-case letter your **first + last** name. It should be lower case. (i.g Chul Min Yeum -> chulmi, Juan Park -> juanp)   
	* `Degree`: pick your degree among BA, ME, MA, and PH (BA=Undergraduate, ME=MEng, MA=MASc, and PH=PhD)  
	* `ID`: your school ID
	* Please do not include any other text except this subject line.    
* Your report includes styled codes for all three problems (please check the Markdown tutorial for code styling). Please see the sample report format [**here**](Task0_juanp_BA_000000). 
* The report must be written with Markdown script (GFM) and all other formats like .docx or .pptx are not permitted. 
* You should also include a report in pdf that is converted from your report in Markdown.  
* In your submission folder, you should include a report in the format of both .pdf and .md in a folder. And, it should be zipped before attaching it to your email. 
* The formats of the folder and files are 
	* Folder name: Task01_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID` (same with the subject of your email)  
	* File names: "Rept_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`.md and .pdf".   
* Please review the general submission instruction in the course syllabus. 
* When you violate these submission guideline, your report may be returned. 

> For example, Juan Park is preparing for the submission. Juan need to submit his report to **uw.task@gmail.com** with an attachment of **Task01_juanp_BA_000000.zip**. In the folder, there are **at least** two files and code files: 
> * Rept_juanp_BA_000000.md
> * Rept_juanp_BA_000000.pdf

**Note**
* You are permitted to **discuss the task with your colleague**, but do not copy the solutions.  
* Your grade depends on the completeness and clarity of your work. 
* You should include clear and concise comments in your codes.

**Announcement**: January 20, 2021        
**1st due date**: January 29, 2021 before 11:59pm  
**2nd due date**: February 05, 2021 before 11:59pm       

The main goal of this task is to understand the fundamental of the data acquisition system and signal processing. You must study all the tutorial to solve the corresponding problems. Please answer all sub-questions in each problem. You might need to write your own code to solve these questions. 

## Problem 1: Sampling (10 points)
**(a)** What is the difference between continuous (or analogue) and discrete (or digital) signals? 

**(b)** Plot a 10 Hz cosine wave with a high sampling rate (nearly analog signal). Please connect the sampled points and plot only four cycles of the wave.     

**(c)** Plot the 10 Hz cosine wave after sampling with 40 Hz. Please plot the sampled data for four cycles of the wave (**do not connect** the sampled points).

**(d)** Plot the 10 Hz cosine wave after sampling with 15 Hz. Please plot only four cycles of the wave (**connect** the sampled points). Do you think that you can get a true frequency of the wave after sampling? 

**(e)** Do you think that you can measure the frequency of the sampled wave in (d) if you add a phase angle to the original wave? For example, the original wave is cos(2&pi;ft + &phi;). Explain your answer. 

**(f)** Do you think that you can measure the frequency of the sampled wave in (d) if you add a dc signal to the original wave? For example, the original wave is cos(2&pi;ft) + d. Explain your answer. 

**(g)** What sampling rate do we use to measure the 10 Hz cosine wave?  

## Problem 2: Aliasing (20 points)

>Aliasing is the phenomenon that the high frequency contents will be ***falsely*** represented by a low frequency and this false frequency is called **alias frequency**. 

**(a)** A 8 Hz sine wave is sampled at 10 Hz. Compute the alias frequency that results from the sampling of the original wave. Plot 12 cycles of the original wave, and overlay the sampled points and connect the points (with a different colour). Please confirm that the sampled signal appears as oscillating with the alias frequency that you found.

**(b)** A 8 Hz sine wave is sampled at 24 Hz. Compute the alias frequency that results from the sampling of the original wave. Plot 12 cycles of the original wave, and overlay the sampled points and connect the points (with a different colour). Please confirm that the sampled signal appears as oscillating with the alias frequency that you found.

**(c)** Assume that the measured signal has a combination of threeperiodic signals:

<!--
y(t)= A1cos2\pi(15)t + A2cos2\pi(45)t + A3cos2\pi(75)t
-->

If the signal is sampled at 120 Hz, determine the frequency content of the sampled signal. 

**(d)** Assume that the measured signal has a combination of periodic signals:  

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y%28t%29%3D%20A1cos2%5Cpi%2815%29t%20&plus;%20A2cos2%5Cpi%2845%29t%20&plus;%20A3cos2%5Cpi%2875%29t)

If the signal is sampled at 160 Hz, determine the frequency content of the sampled signal. 

## Problem 3: Issues in Sampling (15 points)
**(a)** Please explain aliasing. When do they occur? How to avoid them?

**(b)** Please explain quantification errors. When do they occur? How to avoid them?

**(c)** Please explain clipping errors. When do they occur? How to avoid them?  

**(d)** Please explain oversampling issues. When do they occur? What are the consequence of the oversampling? 

**(e)** Assume that a building vibrates with a 5 Hz sine wave: 

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y%3Dcos%282%5Cpi%20f_0%20t%29%20%5Chspace%7B1cm%7D%20f_0%3D5)

and you measured this vibration using your accelerometer and DAQ system. Please write a code to create three different sampled signals that are damaged by (1) aliasing, (2)  quantization error, and (3) clipping error, respectively. Also, generate a signal having an oversampling issue. You should understand the topics of *Aliasing*, *Quantization*, *Clipping*, and *Oversampling* in `data_aquisition_W21_v1.mlx` to solve this problem. You need to explain why your sampled signals contain each of these errors/issues. You can assume any sampling rate, output range, or ADC resolution to generate these signals. Your code should plot these four signals.     

## Problem 4: Fourier Series 1 (10 points)

where f<sub>0</sub> = 15. Please connect sampled points and plot only ten cycles of the wave (You can choose any sampling rate).  

**(b)** Derive a Fourier series (general form) of analytic **wave1**. You should find an analytic equation for coefficients of a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>n</sub>, and b<sub>n</sub>.

**(a)** Plot only ten cycles of a reverse sawtooth wave:

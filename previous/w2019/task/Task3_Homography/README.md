**Announcement**: February 12, 2019  
**1st due date**: February 26, 2019 (Tuesday) before 11:59 pm  
**2nd due date**: March 02, 2019 (Saturday) before 11:59 pm  

The main goal of this task is to understand the fundamental of the homogeneous coordinate and the homography relationship between points on two images of the same planar surface in space. You must study the following three tutorials (`ProjectiveDistortion.mlx`, `ProjectiveGeometryV2.mlx`, `ProjectiveTransformation.mlx`) to solve the corresponding problems. Please answer all sub-questions in each problem. You should write your own code to solve these questions *if needed*. 

## Problem 1: Homogeneous Coordinate (Lines and Points) (10 points)
The intersection of two lines l1 and l2, with l1 passing through the points (0,4) and (3,0), and l2 passing through the points (8,-2) and (10,8). 

**(a)** Compute the intersection without using homogeneous coordinates 

**(b)** Compute the intersection using homogeneous coordinates

## Problem 2: Homogeneous Coordinate (Conic) (10 points)
Given a conic 

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x%5E2%20&plus;%20y%5E2%20&plus;%204x%20&plus;%202y%20-%2029%20%3D0)

**(a)** Compute the intersection of a tangential line to this conic at (1,4) with the y-axis

**(b)** Compute the coorindates of the intersection of the tangents to this conic at points (1,4) and (3, -4)

## Problem 3: Vanishing Line and Point (10 points)

	Use the image of '20190206_155248.jpg'

**(a)** Compute two vanishing point coordinates that are formed from vertical edges and horizontal edges of the paper, respectively. 

**(b)** Compute a vanishing line that connect the above two vanishing points. 

You need to clearly explain how you get the answer with a code or hand calculation.  

**(c)** Please explain how to take a picture of the paper in such a way that the vanishing line becomes a line at infinity. 


## Problem 4: Affine Rectification (10 points)
I take a photo of a rectangular picture frame and the pixel coordinates of the corners of the frame are at P1 = (3,1), P2 = (7, 4), P3 = (8, 2), P4 = (7 -1). Write a code to transform this frame (rectangle) to have only affine distortion (the rectangle determined by new four points has only affine distortion). Please justify why a transformed rectangle has only affine distortion.    

## Problem 5: Linear Algebra (20 points)
**(a)** Find a transpose of inverse H

## Problem 6: Image Overlay (20 points)

|(a): Img_0067.JPG|(b): Img_0069.JPG|
|:-----:|:----:|
|![](IMG_0067.JPG)|![](IMG_0069.JPG)|

You are going to put up a nice picture on a white board in my office. Please first find out a good picture or drawing having an around 4:3 aspect ratio (You can crop the images to make it as 4:3). Then, the image is projected to the white board area in (a) and (b). Write your own code to project your image. You need to find homography between the white board frame in (a) and (b) and your image. Please hanging on a nice picture in my office :smile:  

Here is a sample demo (`demo_problem6.m` in [**problem6**](problem6)).

[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/5jer5NoX7cs/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jer5NoX7cs)

You can make your tool using the code provided or from the scratch. Note that you **should not** use `fitgeotrans` in MATLAB and `findhomography`, `getPerspectiveTransform` in Python. You need to write your own code to find homography (perspective transformation), meaning that you need to write your own `ComputeH`.  

## Problem 7: Build your 3D Planar Measurement Software (30 points)

You are going to make a 3D planar measurement tool using homography. 

Here is a sample demo.  

[![](http://img.youtube.com/vi/_1SB4L98NME/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1SB4L98NME)

A sample code is not provided in this problem because you will implement a "very" similar code used in Problem 6. `drawpolyline` is useful for selecting the line for measurement. 

You need to demonstrate the functionality of your tool using your own image as well as physical measurements. Any size of a calibration paper can be used. Please provide at least two measurements on the plane that the calibration paper is placed. Note that you should not use `fitgeotrans` in MATLAB and `getPerspectiveTransform`in Python. You need to write your own code to find homography (perspective transformation).  

This problem is **NOT** related to two metric rectification methods in class slides.

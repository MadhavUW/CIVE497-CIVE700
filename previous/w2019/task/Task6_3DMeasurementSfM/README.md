# Task6: Development of a 3D measurement tool using structure from motion

**Announcement**: March 14, 2019   
**Due date**: Apr 10, 2019 (Wednesday) before 11:59 pm    

The main goal of this task is to understand the fundamental of structure from motion through developing your own measurement tool. A draft of a code (`demo_code_v8_base.m`) is provided and you need to write your own codes in `YOUR CODE HERE` to complete your tool. 11 Problems  and relevant guidelines are included in the code.   

## Submission of Your Work
* **YOU MUST INCLUDE YOUR RESULTING GRAPHS OR IMAGES INTO YOUR REPORT**
* You should turn in a report and codes to uw.task@gmail.com. When you send your email, please cc your email for future reference.  
* A subject of your email must be the format of "Task6_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`"
	* `Your name`: first five letter your first + last name. The first letter is uppercase and the rest of them are lowercase (i.g Chul Min Yeum -> Chulmi, Juan Park -> Juanp)   
	* `Degree`: pick your degree among BA, ME, MA, and PH (BA=Undergraduate, ME=MEng, MA=MASc, and PH=PhD)  
	* `ID`: your school ID
	* Please do not include any other text except this subject line.    
* For writing equations, I recommend the use of latex equations editors introduced in the Markdown tutorial and inserting equation links. However, I also accept for attaching an image of your handwritten equation (but not recommend). 
* Your report includes your answers and styled codes for questions in the problems.
* The formats of the folder and files are 
	* Folder name: Task6_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID` (same with the subject of your email)  
	* File names: "Code_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`.m or .py" for codes and "Rept_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`.md and .pdf".   
* The report must be written with Markdown script (GFM) and all other formats like docx or pptx are not permitted. 
* You should also include a report in pdf that must be converted from your report in Markdown.
* Please review the general submission instruction in the course syllabus. 
* When you violate these submission guideline, your report will be returned and must be resubmitted. 
> For example, Juan Park is using MATLAB to complete the Task6. Juan needs to submit his report and codes to **uw.task@gmail.com** with an attachment of **Task6_Juanp_BA_000000.zip**. In the folder, there are at least three files: 
> * Code_Juanp_BA_000000.m
> * Rept_Juanp_BA_000000.md
> * Rept_Juanp_BA_000000.pdf
* You may need to include all figures used for writing your report. 

## Note
* Please post a question if you need to help understand the problem and/or tutorials. 
* You are permitted to discuss the task with your **colleagues**.   
* Your grade depends on the completeness and clarity of your work.  
* You should include clear and concise comments in your codes.

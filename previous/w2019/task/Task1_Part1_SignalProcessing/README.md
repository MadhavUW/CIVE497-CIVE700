# Task1: Signal Processing I

**Announcement**: January 27, 2019  
**1st Due Date**: February 03, 2019 (Sunday) before 11:59 pm  
**2nd Due Date**: February 10, 2019 (Sunday) before 11:59 pm  

The main goal of this task is to understand the fundamental of data acquisition system and signal processing. You must study the following two tutorials (`signal_processing_V4.mlx`, `data_aquisition_V3.mlx`) to solve corresponding problems. Please answer all sub-questions in each problem. You should write your own code to solve these questions. 

## Problem 1: Sampling (10 points)
*See Sampling in `data_cquisition_V3.mlx`*  
**(a)** What is the difference between a continuous (or analogue) and discrete (or digital) signals? 

**(b)** Plot a 3 Hz cosine wave with high sampling rate (nearly analog signal). Please connect sampled points and plot only four cycles of the wave.     

**(c)** Plot the 3 Hz cosine wave after sampling with 10 Hz. Please do not connect sampled points and plot the sampled data for four cycles of the wave.

**(d)** Plot the 6 Hz sine wave after sampling with 12 Hz. Please do not connect sampled points  and plot only four cycles of the wave. Do you think that you can measure this wave if you add a phase angle (&phi;) on this sine wave? for example, the wave is sin(2&pi;ft + &phi;).

## Problem 2: Aliasing (10 points)
We learned when aliasing occurs and how it is related to the sampling frequency of the data acquisition system.   
**(a)** A 10 Hz sine wave is sampled at 12 Hz. Compute the alias frequency that can be represented in the resulting sampled signal. Plot the wave and sampled points.

**(b)** A 12 Hz cosine wave is sampled at 12 Hz. Compute the alias frequency that can be represented in the resulting sampled signal. Plot the wave and sampled points.

**(c)** Assume that the measured signal has a complex periodic signal of the form:  

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y%28t%29%20%3D%20A1%20sin%202%5Cpi%20%2825%29t%20&plus;%20A2%20sin%202%5Cpi%20%2875%29t%20&plus;%20A3%20sin%202%5Cpi%20%28125%29t)

If the signal is sampled at 100 Hz, determine the frequency content of the resulting discrete response signal.

## Problem 3: Issues in Sampling (20 points)
**(a)** Please explain a quantization error. When do they occur? How to avoid?

**(b)** Please explain a clipping error. When do they occur? How to avoid?  

**(c)** Please explain an oversampling issue. When do they occur? What are the consequence of the oversampling? 

**(d)** Assume that a building vibrates with a 10 Hz sine wave: 

![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?y%20%3D%20sin%20%282%5Cpi%20f_0%20t%29%20%5C%2C%5C%2C%5C%2C%5C%2C%5C%2C%20f_0%20%3D%310)

and you measured this vibration using your accelerometer and DAQ system. Please write a code to create three different sampled signals that are damaged by aliasing, quantization error and clipping error, respectively. Also, generate a signal having an oversampling issue. You should understand the topics of *Aliasing*, *Quantization*, *Clipping*, and *Oversampling* in `data_cquisition_V3.mlx` to solve this problem. You need to explain why your sampled signals contain each of these errors/issue. You can assume any sampling rate, output range, or ADC resolution to generate these signals. Your code should plot these three signals.     

## Problem 4: Fourier Series 1 (15 points)

where f<sub>0</sub> = 10. Please connect sampled points and plot only ten cycles of the wave.  

**(b)** Derive a Fourier series (general form) of analytic **wave1**. You should find analytic equations for coefficients of a<sub>0</sub>, a<sub>n</sub>, and b<sub>n</sub>. 

**(c)** Derive a Fourier series (complex form) of analytic **wave1**.You should find  an analytic equations for a coefficient of c<sub>n</sub>.

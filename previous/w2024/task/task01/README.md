# Introduction of Digital Image Processing

**Announcement**: January 08, 2023        
**First Submission Deadline**: January 18, 2023 before 11:59pm  
**Second Submission Deadline**: January 25, 2023 before 11:59pm       

## Objective

The primary objective of this assignment is to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of digital image processing, as well as to provide hands-on experience with Python's image processing libraries. Students are expected to thoroughly examine and understand the example codes provided in the `Task01_image_processing.ipynb` file.  Along with the code, there are eight questions to be addressed, each linked to the concepts demonstrated in the examples. It's mandatory for students to submit solutions for all 8 questions, demonstrating their grasp of the material.

Jupyter notebook: [Task01_image_processing_ChulminYeum.ipynb](Task01_image_processing_ChulminYeum.ipynb)


## Submission Guidelines
* Students must submit both a Jupyter notebook file and its PDF conversion.
* The primary grading will be based on the PDF file, but the notebook file may be executed if necessary.
* Ensure all results are executed and displayed in the Jupyter notebook before conversion to PDF. 
* Replace my name with your full name (first and last) at the end of the file names. For example, `Task01_image_processing_NoreenGao.ipynb` and `Task01_image_processing_NoreenGao.pdf`.
* Your submission should include a report in both .pdf and .ipynb formats, contained within a folder. 
* Ensure to include all necessary files within the folder that are required for the successful execution of the Jupyter notebook file.
* The folder, named `Task01_YourName_YourID`, should be zipped before emailing. For example, if your name and ID are Chulmin Yeum and 214102, the folder name becomes `Task01_ChulminYeum_214102`
* Email your work to `uw.task@gmail.com` and cc yourself. Use the subject format `Task01_YourName_YourID`.
* Review the general submission instructions in the course syllabus for further details.
* When you violate these submission guidelines, your report may be returned. 

## Notes
* Please post a question if you need to help understand the problem and/or tutorials. 
* You are permitted to discuss the task with your colleagues, but do not copy the solutions.     
* Your grade depends on the completeness and clarity of your work.  
* You should include clear and concise comments in your codes.

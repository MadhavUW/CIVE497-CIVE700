* You can push "Run Script" after typing your code into it. 
* This process is to check if your code is working properly without syntax errors. Also, you can print out the output to check the values stored in variables.  
* Note that this is nothing to do with evaluating the correctness of your code. Your code has not been tested or submitted yet.

## Submitting/Fixing Solutions 
* Once you confirm that there is no syntax error, click the "Submit" button on the end of the page to check if your code is correct or not using pre-designed tests.
* You can submit your solution as many times as you would like until all tests get passed for your assignment (not quizzes)
* Although you pass all tests, you can fix your solutions (Click "Improve This Solution").

* If you do not pass the tests, click the "Fix This Solution" button to get your solution fixed.

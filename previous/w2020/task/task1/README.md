# Task1: Programming Practice

**Announcement**: January 6, 2019 (Monday)  
**Due Date**: January 17, 2019 (Friday) before 11:59 pm  

**Problem Description**  
The main goal of this task is to practice programming to solve upcoming task assignments throughout the course. It is a good opportunity for reviewing the programming course that you took in your undergraduate. You should write your program in MATLAB. Three problems have been posted in MATLAB grader. This tool gives you instant feedback on the correctness of your solution through the pre-designed testers. You can solve the problems until you pass all the testers in each problem. 

Before solving the problem, please complete the "Tutorial" in MATLAB Grader.   

**Submission of Your Work**
* You should turn in a report to uw.task@gmail.com. When you send your email, please cc your email for future reference.  
* A subject of your email must be the format of "Task1_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`"
	* `Your name`: first five letter your first + last name. It should be lower case. (i.g Chul Min Yeum -> chulmi, Juan Park -> Juanp)   
	* `Degree`: pick your degree among BA, ME, MA, and PH (BA=Undergraduate, ME=MEng, MA=MASc, and PH=PhD)  
	* `ID`: your school ID
	* Please do not include any other text except this subject line.    
* Your report includes styled codes for all three problems (please check the Markdown tutorial for code styling). Please see the sample report format [**here**](Task0_Juanp_BA_000000). 
* The report must be written with Markdown script (GFM) and all other formats like .docx or .pptx are not permitted. 
* You should also include a report in pdf that is converted from your report in Markdown.  
* In your submission folder, you should include a report in the format of both .pdf and .md in a folder. And, it should be zipped before attaching it to your email. 
* The formats of the folder and files are 
	* Folder name: Task1_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID` (same with the subject of your email)  
	* File names: "Rept_`Your name` _ `Degree` _ `ID`.md and .pdf".   
* Please review the general submission instruction in the course syllabus. 
* When you violate these submission guideline, your report may be returned and must be resubmitted. 

> For example, Juan Park is preparing for the submission. Juan need to submit his report to **uw.task@gmail.com** with an attachment of **Task1_Juanp_BA_000000.zip**. In the folder, there are at least two files: 
> * Rept_Juanp_BA_000000.md
> * Rept_Juanp_BA_000000.pdf

**Note**
* You are permitted to **discuss the task with your colleague**.  
* Your grade depends on the completeness and clarity of your work. 
* You should include clear and concise comments in your codes.

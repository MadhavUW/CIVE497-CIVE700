|Nokia Lumia 1020|A unique phone camera is the Nokia Lumia 1020. This camera has a 41 megapixel rear camera and is still widely regarded as one of the best camera phones of its generation. Its unprecedent sensor size for a phone is what makes it stand out from the rest of the phones. |
|ZTE Axon 20 5G|The ZTE Axon 20 5G is a very unique camera module in that the front facing camera is situated beneath the screen. As such the amount of real estate on the screen is higher but at the cost of image quality. Due to the way the phone is designed, there are materials situated overtop of the camera causing a very poor image quality with blown out highlights and a softer image.|
|OnePlus 7 Pro|The OnePlus 7 Pro is another unique phone camera design in that it also tries to solve the problem of increasing the amount of screen size by removing the front facing camera, but they take a different approach. This front facing camera is hidden within the phone and had a motor that will allow the camera to pop-up when the user wants the use it. Despite lots of skeptical critics, the OnePlus 7 Pro received phenomenal reviews regarding its mechanism, and it could pave the way for future smartphone cameras.|
|Blackview BV9800|The Blackview BV9800 Pro is a very unique phone in that its one of the first smartphones to offer **thermal** imaging as one of its options. This can become very prominent in the building science industry as engineers may now opt for a phone and thermal imaging combo as opposed to buying each separately. The being said the thermal imaging camera only has a resolution of 60 x 80 but also comes with a 48 MP three lens camera as well.|
|Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom|Samsung Galaxy S4 Zoom was first introduced in 2013. This phone has a very unique camera where it incorporates a 10x optical zoom lens. The back of the phone looks very similar to a point-and-shoot camera. (https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/phones/galaxy-s/samsung-galaxy-s4-zoom-sm-c105azwaatt/)|
|Samsung S21 Ultra 5G|Samsung S21 Ultra 5G is able to capture 8k videos, which will remain to be high-quality even when being projected to a TV that is much bigger size than a phone screen (https://www.samsung.com/ca/smartphones/galaxy-s21-ultra-5g/).|
|Huawei P40|Huawei P40 series phones are equipped with 1/1.28 inch sensors, which are significanlty larger than other phone camera sensors. Also, its multi-spectrum colour temperature sensor has 8 colour channels as opposed to tradition 3 colour channels. This allows for more precise colours being captured in the images. (https://consumer.huawei.com/en/campaign/p40/sophisticated-camera-system/).|
|iPhone 11 pro|iPhone 11 pro is equipped with three cameras that have different aperture sizes, making it good for shooting images of both far-away and close-up objects.|
|iPhone 12 pro|iPhone 12 pro, in addition to the three regular cameras introduced on iPhone 11 pro, also includes a **LiDAR scanner**, which improves autofocus in low light and can be used to measure distances. (https://www.apple.com/ca/iphone-12-pro/)|
|Oppo Reno 3 Pro|Oppo Reno 3 Pro has a function called ‘Ultra Clear 108MP Image” which merges multiple photos together to create a high resolution photo.|
|Vivo NEX 3S 5G|Vivo NEX 3S 5G has a unique camera module protruding out of the top of the phone preventing obstruction from the users hands|
|Oppo R15 Camera Module|Oppo R15  camera incorporates AI Scene Recognition technology, which identifies 120  scenes. R15's rear camera is equipped with a dual-lens module that can  produce excellent depth-of-field effects. In addition, the Sensor HDR  Technology also allows users to take good selfies in backlight conditions by  deploying the exposure gradients within the pixels for higher dynamic range  and better imaging effect. |
|OnePlus 2 Camera Module|The  OnePlus 2 camera has a laser autofocus system which locks in a touch-free and  precise focus in under 0.2 seconds. The camera also has advanced OIS system  which automatically corrects for unwanted shakes and bumps, producing  incredibly sharp pictures and impossibly smooth videos. |
|Moon Wheel shaped Camera design|On 17th January 2020, Oppo applied for a patent with the State Intellectual Property Office of the People’s Republic of China. An exciting and unique thing in this patent is a rear camera design. The Patents reveal that the rear cameras are arranged around a semi-circular area. The overall appearance of the cameras is a moon-shaped. |
| OnePlus X McLaren|In this concept, the glass at the back can become opaque to hide the cameras. In fact, when the camera app opens, the lenses quickly appear to take photos but after closing the app, the glass goes dark again. One reason behind this concept is to make the smartphones with a lot of lenses seem more beautiful and cool, hiding the lenses. The glass can also become semi-transparent which allows users to take photos and videos in very bright sunlight without everything blown out. |
|Double-sided pop-up camera|In this design, a single pop-up camera module can capture photos both forward and backward out of a single unit, using mirrors. Actually, the pop-up module uses two mirrors which are arranged in the shape of a triangle. This system reflects light paths as needed to change the direction that the two cameras can capture. |
|Oukitel WP7 with IR Night Vision Camera|It is the only smartphone to feature an **InfraRed** night vision camera. It has the option of attaching modular accessories such as UVC sterilisation attachment and high performance flashlight to enhance its night vision abilities.|
|Motorola Polaroid Mod for Moto Z|As a part of its modular camera development for Moto Z, Motorola introduced the Polaroid Insta-Share Printer which attached to the Moto Z magnetically and can print instant pictures without any ink using special "Zink" paper from Polaroid. It can hold 10 sheets of paper and is compatible with any phone in the Moto Z family.|
|LiDAR on iPhone 12 Pro|Apple took the high road in depth sensing and portrait photography using the ultimate depth sensing tool: LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging). It can be thought of as the Face ID sensor with a longer range. LiDAR can do so much more than better photos and has applications in 3D segmentation, architectural modelling, augmented reality to name a few.|
|Asus Zenfone 7 and 7 Pro|These phones have a primary rear camera which can pop up and rotate to take front facing selfies. It eliminates the need of including notches or punch holes to include selfie cameras. Additionally, better rear sensors can be used to take selfies.|
|Smartphone design with detachable camera module|OPPO patented the design of a smartphone with a detachable camera module in 2020. This is a new design to smartphone cameras. We can see that the detachable camera module is located at the back. It contains a dual-camera setup with an LED flash, in together they can be connected through USB Type-C to the phone (Gizmochina, 2020).|
|DepthVision Camera|DepthVision Camera is a smartphone camera module released by Samsung on Galaxy S20+ and S20 Ultra. It uses the known speed of light to calculate the depth and distance and hence map out 3D images (Samsung, n.d.).|
|Rotating Phone Camera Module|Xiaomi patented smartphone design with external rotating camera module in 2020. It can be seen that the design contains a rotating dual camera at the rear-facing. The module allows 360 degrees rotation. The set also allows twisting to extend one hidden camera out and act as the front camera.|

#  What kind of phone cameras or phone camera technologies will be introduced in next five years?

|Comments|

|I believe phone cameras with optical zoom will be created (instead of having multiple lenses) in order to provide user with better image quality. Some sort of lidar may also be present in the upcoming years in order to be able to measure distance from a phone camera for numerous applications with computer vision. Technologies focusing on different wavelengths may also become common place with examples of thermal cameras already evolving into smart phones.|
|With the rapid development of technology, phone cameras will likely continue to evolve in the next couple of years in terms of their resolution. In addition to hardware upgrades, more AI infused technology will also liley be introduced to auto adjust//improve image quality to further extent. Also, as it is already seen on many phones (for example, iPhone 12 pro), depth and distance recognition technology can be appllied on VR technology. Future phones may come with built-in 360 degree cameras that are compatible with VR devices. |
|I think megapixels per photo will increase following the current upward trending trajectory and with larger image sensors. Addition of extra cameras allowing for different apertures and focal lengths is very likely as well. Perhaps phone camera technologies will progress to where aperture and focal length is variable with a single camera. |
|I believe AI with continue to super-charge phone camera software and enhance digital zoom capabilities. In addition, we may see out-of-the-box computer vision features become standard in camera modules to identify common household objects. From a hardware standpoint, I believe front facing cameras will get smaller and rear facing cameras will become larger and more plentiful. If the trend continues, I could imagine seeing externally mounted phone-camera lenses come standard with new phones (some are already available).|
|As it is mentioned in the lecture, one of the main focuses still will be on developing crop sensors in order to decrease the difference between smart phone cameras and DSLR cameras. Also, the number of lenses will be increased to capture higher quality photos. Another thing will be the pattern of placing lenses. I have read an idea about the future camera design which is very interesting. It says that in near future, the smartphone designers might put cameras on a flexible case rather than on the phone which allows for a much greater distance between multiple camera modules. This can improve the potential for three-dimensional capture and more importantly, allows the user to adjust the cameras’ positions relative to one another by bending or folding the case as necessary.|
|**Modular phone cameras:** Removable and customisable camera sensors have been in the development for some time now. These cameras will have the potential to be connected, removed and replaced as and when required according to the scene being captured. This will be a step closer to removing the boundary between DSLR Camera and Phone Camera. *Note:* Motorola briefly introduced Hasselblad True Zoom in 2016 mod as a part of its Moto Mods program which could be attached to Moto Z with a magnetic back.
|**In-display selfie camera:** The ugly and distracting display notches and pop cameras can be a thing of the past if this technology is refined in the next few years. "ZTE Axon 20 5G" (image included below) managed to put out the phone with this technology amidst mediocre reviews. Photos taken with its selfie camera have been called "hazy, weak colors, and soft". If behind-the-scenes technologies such as metamaterials, pixel demosaicing and pixel filters can be perfected, this can be the standard feature in all smartphones within the next 5 years.|
|**Multiple Sensors with Tilting Mechanism:** Samsung patented a technology which uses an array of 6 cameras with tilting capabilities. (Source: [https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/06/18/samsung-patents-a-crazy-6-camera-tilting-array-for-smartphones/](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/06/18/samsung-patents-a-crazy-6-camera-tilting-array-for-smartphones/)). The unique technology will be used to take panoramic landscapes with bokeh effect.|
|Based on Class 07 and research for Question 4, I would make a rough guess on phone cameras in next five years. First, the image quality will be closer to DSLR cameras, probably with greater amount of pixel and larger sensor size, or with the use of other technologies that replace the necessity of large sensor size. Second, there might be more flexibility on camera locations. Both rear and front cameras might be detachable, and the front band for front cameras might be abandoned for larger display area. Next, the time-of-flight (ToF) technologies on phone cameras might be revolutionary. With known speed of light, ToF measures the distance and depth between the camera and the subject for each point of the image. 3D images are able to be captured with this technique. Looking at the hot trend on AR (augmented reality), incorporating high level of AR function in phones will be the upcoming news in the industry.|
|In terms of camera hardware, new technologies will probably consist of just improving upon current hardware. Samsung is reportedly working on developing a 600MP camera sensor, which is almost six time the resolution of the largest sensors used today. Using such a large sensor would require the size of each pixel to be reduced significantly. Otherwise, the camera hardware would be far too large to fit into a smartphone. However, this results in less light being captured by each pixel. To resolve this, many smartphones use pixel binning to combine multiple pixels into one. Ultimately, there is only so much space in a smartphone, and this constrains the potential hardware development. This is why smartphone camera technology is driven by software developements and not hardware. The top smartphone cameras are those found on the iPhone and the Google Pixel series. These phones have relatively mundane hardware compared to other smartphone brands, but their software and image processing capabilities more than make up for that. For example, the latest flagship models from Apple and Google use 12MP and 12.2MP resolutions on their main cameras, which is far smaller than the 48MP or even 108MP seen on some lesser phones. Smartphone camera software is more important than hardware, and I suspect that will remain the case over the next five years. This will likely include more advancements in computational photography which uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to extract more detail from images and improve features such as digital zoom and low-light shots.|
|In the next 5 years, I think that a few key developments will occur for phone cameras. The first would be an increase to the megapixel count. Currently, phones are reaching 108MP, bit I think it will continue to rise. In addition, LiDAR or TOF sensors are being implemented to high end phones, but I think they will be widely available for both front facing and rear facing cameras in the next 5 years. They will allow cameras to take better portraits and allow for beeter bokeh in the finalized photos.|
|If we look at the current trend of phone cameras, it can be seen that more and more rear cameras are being added in order to increase sensor size and image quality. In addition, the number of megapixels per camera are steadily increasing as well. It can be expected that these trends will continue as hardware continues to improve. Perhaps, 108MP phone camera sensors will become the norm, with special cameras having even more megapixels. It also seems likely that computational  photography technologies for smartphone cameras will become prevalent - Combining data from multiple sensors and performing operations on the|

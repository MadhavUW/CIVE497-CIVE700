## Comment
The Nyquist frequency is 30 Hz, which is the half of the sampling frequency of 60Hz. There exists 40 Hz alising frequency but it is not detected because it is below the Nyquist frequency. From the aliasing diagram, the aliasing frequency becomes 20Hz, (4-100/30)*30Hz = 20Hz. 

The aliasing frequency placed below the Nyquist frequency is occurred when the original frequency wave is shifted to 2fs in the right direction (orange signal).
